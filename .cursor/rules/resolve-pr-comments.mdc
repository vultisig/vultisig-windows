# Resolve PR Review Comments

Address all review comments on a pull request and resolve conversations to make it merge-ready.

## Usage

Provide the PR link or number. The agent will:
1. Fetch all unresolved review comments
2. Address each comment with code changes or explanations
3. Push changes and resolve all conversations

## Workflow

### 1. Fetch Review Comments

Use GitHub MCP to get all review threads:

```
pull_request_read with method: "get_review_comments"
```

Focus on threads where `IsResolved: false`.

### 2. Address Each Comment

For each unresolved comment:

- **If actionable**: Implement the suggested fix
- **If disagree**: Still resolve, but reply explaining why (e.g., "Skipping because X")
- **If unclear**: Make best judgment call and note it in the reply

Group related changes and make edits efficiently.

### 3. Run Checks

After all changes:

```bash
yarn check
```

Fix any errors before proceeding.

### 4. Push Changes

Commit and push all changes to the PR branch:

```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "address review comments" && git push
```

### 5. Resolve All Conversations

For each comment thread, reply with a brief summary of what was done, then resolve the conversation.

Use GitHub MCP to reply to each thread, acknowledging the feedback.

## Goal

After completion:
- All review threads should be resolved
- All checks should pass
- PR should be ready to merge with no blocking conversations
