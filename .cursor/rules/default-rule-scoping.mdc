# Default Rule Scoping Strategy

## TypeScript Codebase Rule Targeting

When creating Cursor rules for this TypeScript codebase, default to using file-specific targeting rather than descriptions or always-apply rules.

## Default Approach

- Use `globs: *.ts,*.tsx` for most coding standards and practices
- Use `globs: *.tsx` for React-specific rules
- Use `globs: *.ts` for non-React TypeScript rules
- Use `alwaysApply: true` only for project-wide architectural guidance
- Use `description:` for rules that need manual activation

## Examples

<example>
```
---
globs: *.ts,*.tsx
---
# TypeScript coding standard that applies to all TS files
```
</example>

<example>
```
---
globs: *.tsx
---
# React component specific rule
```
</example>

<example type="invalid">
```
---
description: Some coding standard
---
# Should use globs instead for better targeting
```
</example>

## Rationale

File-specific targeting ensures rules are contextually relevant and reduces noise for the AI agent when working on specific file types.
