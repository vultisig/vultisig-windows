# Monorepo Package Imports

## Context

- When importing files from other packages in the monorepo
- Applies to all TypeScript and TypeScript React files in the project
- This is a monorepo with packages

## Requirements

- Within the same package, relative imports are allowed and preferred for local modules
- When importing from a different package, always use the package name from its package.json
- Do not use relative paths that traverse outside the current package to reach another package (e.g., '../../../../other-package/...')
- Maintain consistency with the monorepo package structure

## Examples

<example>
// Good: Relative imports within the same package
import { useThing } from './state/useThing'
import { Button } from '../components/Button'
</example>

<example type="invalid">
// Bad: Crossing package boundary via relative path
import { useIsInitiatingDevice } from '../../../../state/isInitiatingDevice'
</example>

<example>
// Good: Cross-package import uses package name
import { useIsInitiatingDevice } from '@your-org/state/isInitiatingDevice'
</example>
