# TypeScript Type Checking

## Context
- Only run typecheck when making changes that could potentially affect other files or introduce complex type issues
- Avoid running typecheck for simple, isolated changes like adding translations, styling updates, or single-file modifications

## When to Use
- After modifying shared types, interfaces, or utility functions
- When adding new dependencies or changing import/export structures
- After refactoring that spans multiple files
- When encountering TypeScript errors that might have cascading effects
- When making changes to core infrastructure or shared components

## When NOT to Use
- Simple translation updates or i18n changes
- Styling or CSS-only modifications
- Single-file component updates that don't change interfaces
- Adding new isolated components
- Minor bug fixes within a single file

## Requirements
- Use `yarn typecheck` from the root of the monorepo to verify all TypeScript types are correct
- Only run when the changes justify the time investment

## Command
```bash
yarn typecheck
```
