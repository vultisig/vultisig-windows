description: Run pnpm check for multi-file changes; skip trivial edits

## Run pnpm check when changes may affect correctness across files

- **Use it** for multi-file edits, shared types/utils, refactors, import/export changes, or public API updates.
- **Skip it** for trivial, isolated edits (styling, markup-only changes, small single-file fixes that don't change interfaces).

This runs TypeScript type checks, ESLint, and unused code detection in one step.

```bash
pnpm check
```
