## Run yarn check after finishing a task

You MUST run `yarn check` after completing the task. This is mandatory and non-negotiable.

Run TypeScript, ESLint, and unused code checks after finishing the task. If any errors are reported, fix them and rerun until there are no errors.

```bash
yarn check
```

**Workflow:**

1. Complete the requested changes
2. Run `yarn check` immediately
3. If errors are found, fix them:
   - **Unused exports/files**: Delete unused exports, functions, or entire files reported by knip
   - **TypeScript errors**: Fix type errors
   - **ESLint errors**: Fix linting issues (use autofix when appropriate)
4. Rerun `yarn check` until it passes with **no errors or warnings**
5. Only then consider the task complete

**Important**: When knip reports unused exports or files, you must remove them. This includes:

- Unused exported functions
- Unused exported types (if the file has no other purpose)
- Entire unused files

Do not skip this step when `@check.mdc` is mentioned in the user's request.
