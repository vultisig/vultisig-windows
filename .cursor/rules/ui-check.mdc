# Browser Testing

After implementing UI changes, verify them in the browser:

1. **Use existing browser session** if one is already open in Cursor
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:8081`
3. Take a snapshot to verify the changes

## If the app is not running or broken

If no app is running at `http://localhost:8081`, or hot reload stopped working:

```bash
# Kill any existing process on port 8081
lsof -ti:8081 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || true

# Start the app
cd /Users/rodion/vultisig/windows && wails dev
```

Run the app in background and wait for it to be ready before testing.
