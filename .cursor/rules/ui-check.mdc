# Browser Testing

After implementing UI changes, verify them in the browser.

## Prerequisites

Before browser testing, ensure `yarn check` passes with no errors. Code errors can cause the app to fail or not work properly.

## Testing Steps

1. **Use existing browser session** if one is already open in Cursor
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:8081`
3. Take a snapshot to verify the changes

## If the app is not responding

Try these steps in order:

1. **Reload the browser page** - hot reload may have stalled
2. **If reload doesn't work**, restart the dev server as a last resort:

```bash
# Kill any existing process on port 8081
lsof -ti:8081 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || true

# Start the app
yarn dev
```

Run the app in background and wait for it to be ready before testing.
